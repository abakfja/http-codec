# About
A netty like network application framework, made using C++.
## Philosophy
Since performance is of the most importance:
1. Start from scratch
2. Build a Feature
3. Test
4. Optimize tillno overhead
5. 2
## Plan
First I'll be working on a http codec for request encoding and decoding
from there on out I'll be working on other features
